The aim is to make historical data accessible to a wide audience.     </p>      <h2>A window into the past</h2>     <p>       From the humble beginnings in 1880, with the first telephone directory containing just 99 entries and no telephone numbers, to the detailed directories with job titles, addresses and married women's maiden names - old telephone directories are veritable treasure troves of history. Telephone directories are also publicly accessible directories of residents. They offer fascinating insights into social development and make it possible to trace the development of people and companies over time.     </p>      <p>       historic.localsearch currently includes retro-digitised historical telephone directories from 1880 to 1950. The digitisation of telephone directories from 1950 onwards is still in progress. Irrespective of this, the quality of the platform is constantly being improved.     </p>      <h2>Joint project PTT Archive, Digital Humanities the University of Berne and localsearch</h2>     <p>       historic.localsearch is a joint project between the PTT Archives, the University of Berne and localsearch. The database was developed thanks to the expertise of the PTT Archives and Digital Humanities as well as the financial support of localsearch. Heike Bazak (Head of the PTT Archive) and Tobias Hodel (Professor Digital Humanities at the University of Berne) share the project management.     </p>      <h2>Further information and legal framework</h2>     <p>       In accordance with the Federal Law on Archiving, the telephone directories will remain publicly accessible until the end of 1997.

The following search strategies will help you to use the telephone directory database. </p>  <h2>Start the search process</h2> <p>Enter a search term and press ENTER.</p>  <p>The search engine displays hits per year. Click on ‘More years’ to display the following year.</p>  <h2>Narrow down your search</h2> <ul>     <li><u>Time restriction:</u> Limit the search to a desired period within the time span from 1880 to 1950.</li>     <li><u>Exact search:</u> Finds exact matches of the search text.</li>     <li><u>Approximate search:</u> Use this if the entry you are looking for is not found.
